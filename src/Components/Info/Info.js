                      Kathy Wilson is recognized for her keen sense of style, attention to detail, and dedication to creating the perfect environment for her clients’ needs.
                      She has established herself in the field of interior design for the past 15 years. Her passion of decorating interior spaces became her lifelong dream.
                      She first started helping to design and enhance homes for family and friends,
                      which led her to attend The Art Institute of Nevada.  Kathy pursued her career in interior design.

                      Her designs represent environments with style, comfort, and functionality. She is capable of producing “turnkey” projects,
                      and manages all aspects of a project from commencement to completion, including: color schemes, design development, bidding,
                      construction management, window treatments, furnishings and accessorizing. With hard work Kathy takes the ordinary and makes it spectacular.
                      The ultimate goal is to achieve a design that reflects who you are and how you live.
